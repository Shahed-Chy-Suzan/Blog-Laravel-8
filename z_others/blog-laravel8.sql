Especially in interior decore, these floor lamps can create mood and atmosphere. Floor lamps play an important role even in any furniture used in interior decoration. In addition to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/pendant-lights/\">pendant lights</a>, floor lamps can be used in many ways, so they are also used in the interior. These lamps are a weapon that you can use in many ways if you want. Besides, without lighting, no interior style will stand out. Let&rsquo;s learn more about the role of floor lamps in interior decor and how they make a room stand out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOOR LAMPS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ল্যাম্প \" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-juan-pablo-serrano-arenas-1612726.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great as an ambient light</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 types of lighting are commonly seen in layering lighting. One is<strong>&nbsp;ambient lighting, task lighting&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>accent lighting</strong>. Separately you can use floor lamps in this type of lighting. Ambient light refers to ordinary lights. These lights can be used in almost all the rooms of the house. Floor lamps also look great as ambient lights. Then comes task lights, many people also use them as desk lights. This type of light can be seen in reading corners in the office or at home. If you want, you can easily use the floor lights as task lights. Accent lighting is used to highlight any special space or painting inside the house. This accent lighting is also often used to refer to the center point of the home. Floor lamps can be an excellent option for use in the center of the house. Floor lamps can undoubtedly be used in these three types of work. It is possible to change the mood of the interior of the house by using tall lamps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PORTABLE&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ফ্লোর ল্যাম্প\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-steve-johnson-896407.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Floor lamps are easily portable</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t change the color of our walls very frequently. It is a rare occurrence. However, if you live in a bigger apartment then you can occasionally re-position the furniture. However, for those who live in small houses, it is difficult to move the furniture. In such a context, floor lamps play a very useful role. If you want, you can place the lamps anywhere as per your wish and need for the convenience of the interior. On the other hand, these lamps are groundbreaking to give a significant look to the furniture. Space plays a big role in changing the look and outlook. These lamps are the first choice of many to create a different mood in any corner of the house. You can use these lamps as needed in all the houses. The size of the lamps is quite portable so you can put them in the corridor of the house.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ADDS HEIGHT AND ELEGANCE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ফ্লোর ল্যাম্প\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-ulrike-h%C3%A4%C3%9Fler-1484981.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Floor lamps play a vital role in creating elegance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most effective way to make any small space look bigger is to use a vertical shape. An induction of height can be created indoors using verticals. Long strip curtains, high narrow bookshelves, etc. can create a long outlook in the room. Floor lamps do exactly the same thing. Long stick floor lamps can add height to a room. Floor lamps play a vital role in creating elegance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CAN CREATE A STATEMENT&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ল্যাম্প\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pexels-victoria-borodinova-1648776.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lamps can always create a different atmosphere</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Floor lamps can be a major feature of a home, which you can use to match the theme if you want. If you want, you can use angle standing lights with mid-century style. It will create a stylish ambience inside the house. Lamps can always create a different atmosphere.

And that is the story of almost every one of us. &ldquo;Banani 11&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just a road, it has become an unconscious part of our everyday lives. However, contrary to popular belief, Banani Road 11 wasn&rsquo;t always the busy social hub that it is today. The chaotic &ldquo;BFC building&rdquo; was once a home filled with the laughter of kids. The iconic Road 11 was originally intended to serve as a residential area as part of Banani. However, despite being termed as such, the street did not gain the level of popularity for residential purposes as expected. Over time, quite a few significant changes took place and they were the main reasons behind the phenomena that Banani 11 is today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DURING THE 90S</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1.3 km long street, which ended at the lake separating Gulshan and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/advantages-of-living-in-banani/\">Banani</a>, was dotted with a small number of houses.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/banani-next-choice-neighborhood/\">Road 11 was a great place for neighborhood folks</a>&nbsp; to go for a nice afternoon or evening stroll in the 1990s. There was a strong sense of community there, and nearly everyone on the street knew each other. Every now and then, members from each building would gather to either celebrate a special occasion or simply pass the time with some good old-fashioned gossip. It was a pretty close-knit community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the words of Rina Mubin, a long-time resident of the area, Road 11 had gradually lost the charm that it once held as a community. &ldquo;When my kids were growing up in the area, Banani 11 was the place where all their friends would meet up and even go for a walk during the evening. Now the crazy traffic and restaurants at every other corner represent the new Banani 11.I don&rsquo;t think people realize that this place was once built to be a residential area. Oh, how time flies!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BRIDGING THE GAP</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Banani road 11 bridge\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8624.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The famous Banani 11 bridge was built in 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banani road 11 experienced an unexpected change in 2008. A bridge was built over the Gulshan Lake, connecting&nbsp; the two areas. This set in motion a chain of events that transformed Banani Road 11 from a seemingly quiet residential street to a highly sought-after commercial location. Some people began to leave, relocating to a less crowded area suitable for a home. Others began to rent out their residential building spaces to accommodate small businesses. Whatever the exchange was, it was quite evident that a revolutionary change was taking place in the area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth of different businesses was also a significant change that everyone witnessed in Banani 11. Larger corporations gradually moved in with their offices. Banani Road 11 had completely transformed into a commercial hub within a decade. Restaurants, pharmacies, hotels, businesses, fashion stores, you name it, Banani road 11 has it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/5-most-popular-restaurants-in-banani/\">Banani is known for being the hotspot for restaurants</a>. Many restaurant businesses have started their journey from this road and went on to become successful franchises.&nbsp;<em>Yum Cha District</em>&nbsp;is an ideal example of that. Keeping the business aspect in mind, the popular pan-asian restaurant&nbsp;<em>Yum Cha District&nbsp;</em>started its journey from this iconic road. Explaining their logic behind choosing the road for their business venture, one of the partners of the restaurant Adnan Khan said, &ldquo;With full confidence in what we were offering, we believed Banani 11 would be the perfect place to start our business. The reason being, people from every area of the city visits Banani 11 almost on a regular basis. As we have now been in business for over 6 years now and have expanded the business all over the city, you can say it was a pretty good decision from our end.&rdquo;</p>', '2021-11-15 05:13:49', '2021-11-15 05:13:49'),

In these fairs, we get a chance to market all sorts of exclusive properties more efficiently and effectively to potential buyers who are actually willing to invest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PRINT MEDIA</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"brochure\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_20211024_135128.jpg\" style=\"height:1005px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We take full advantage of print media</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People who come to us seeking new properties, we always guide them in the right direction by understanding their needs first.

While stocks, bonds and mutual funds are still considered common investment options, there are many other avenues that can also be rewarding in the long run, if you are willing to put in the time. One such avenue is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/types-real-estate-investments/\" target=\"_blank\">real estate investment</a>. However when it comes to young real estate investors, the stakes are quite high. Because for unknown reasons, real estate is considered to be an investment opportunity for the older generation. But the good news is, the new generation is now getting more and more interested in investing in real estate. In spite of the growing interest , many young people don&rsquo;t even know where to start. So in today&rsquo;s article, we have listed down some important real estate tips for young investors to help them start their investment journey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RESEARCH THE MARKET&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Research the market\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_280262480.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research the market well to know the prospects</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first step towards investing in real estate is getting well educated and getting enough knowledge about the market. How could you possibly know that you even want to be a real estate investor without knowing what&rsquo;s actually involved? Just because real estate is a lucrative market, that shouldn&rsquo;t be your only motivation. Otherwise it can be a major money pit. Research on what kinds of projects will yield the highest ROI for you. Know more about the trends, market ups and downs, future prospects and then decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PLAN AHEAD</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Plan for the future\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1431813467.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning will save you from failing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning is key in every business. And real estate investment is not above it as well. Real estate investment can be complicated and demanding, and a solid plan can keep young investors organized and on task. Do you think with your current income you can save enough to submit the down payment of your first house? Are you eligible to apply for a home loan with your current income? Will your partner be able to help you out during a sudden financial crisis? What are your back-up options if there is a sudden inflation in the market? These are some of the important questions to ask yourself before you consider moving ahead with the investment plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>KNOW WHAT YOU WANT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Know what you want \" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_143785585.jpg\" style=\"height:800px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Know what suits best for you</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youngsters get a bad name for not knowing what they want. But if you let your young enthusiasm get in the way then planning to invest in real estate might backfire for you. There are many different streams of real estate. You need to figure out which one is right for you. Do you want to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/benefits-flipper-house/\" target=\"_blank\">flip a property</a>? Or do you want to leave behind assets for your next generation? Are you interested in owning land? Or are you looking for an apartment to rent out and generate a steady income for yourself? Once you put your finger on what it is that you want, your investment prospects will open up tremendously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAVINGS WILL SAVE YOU</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"tips for young real estate investors\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_520832017.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Savings can help you start your investment journey</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you who are super serious about starting to invest in real estate, savings will help you. Depending only on external funding will put a break on your investment dreams if you don&rsquo;t have something saved up to kick start your dream. If you are living paycheck to paycheck then picking up a side hustle could be the way to go for you. Online platforms&nbsp;<em>Upwork</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fiber</em>&nbsp;provide great opportunities for you to start earning some extra money. Rent is another way you can save up some extra cash. If possible try moving in with your parents and save that money for later. You can also choose to live in an affordable area to save money on rent. You will be surprised to see how much you can save.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REGULATION CHANGES</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Real estate changes \" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_138129767.jpg\" style=\"height:958px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep an eye on any significant changes in interest rates or current market trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real estate investment is all about keeping yourself updated with the recent market trends. Just a small change in the regulations can make or break your investment prospects. So one of the biggest tips for young real estate investors is to take advantage of regulation changes. Keep an eye on any significant changes in interest rates, tax breaks or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/tips-real-estate-trends-bangladesh/\">current market trends</a>. For instance, in April 2020, Banks in the country started implementing single digit (9 per cent) interest rates for all kinds of loans (apart from credit cards) in compliance with the government which was previously as high as 13 per cent. So those who took advantage of this opportunity, were highly benefited in the long run as the deduction of the rate had a huge impact on their final payable loan amount.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how appealing it may look from the outside, being a successful young real estate investor is challenging to say the least. However, by just keeping in mind these simple tips mentioned in the article, you will definitely be one step closer to becoming a successful real estate investor.</p>', '2021-11-15 05:17:35', '2021-11-15 05:17:35'),

To me, the arrangement of people having all sorts of fun in flocks, in a setting that could only be compared to a dream full of happiness was like magic. In the little brain of mine, the yet unfathomable positive energy and spirit of people living, breathing, and enjoying was hypnotizing. As far as I can remember, me watching everything unfold before my eyes and having cotton candy while standing in between the ferry&rsquo;s wheel and puppet show stall is what I can clearly recall being awestruck for the very first time in my life. To me, fair sparked joy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-18-scaled.jpg\" style=\"height:1920px; width:2560px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are thousands of fairs in Bangladesh that&rsquo;s been held throughout the year</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as I grew older, I realized a fair is not just a festival and arrangement that makes people happy. It is much more than that. It is a reflection of our culture and tradition. From the Bengali month of Hemanta to Chaitra, you will always find a fair almost every month in some part of our country. It&rsquo;s rooted in our tradition; weaved as though it is an active part of our culture itself. And you will be fascinated by the arrangement surrounding all these fairs the most. Having that said, here are some of the most popular folk fairs in Bangladesh that are also culturally impactful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BAISHAKHI FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"folk fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-20-scaled.jpg\" style=\"height:1707px; width:2560px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Handicrafts are the main attractions of folk fairs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among all the different fairs in Bangladesh, the Baishakhi fair is the most popular one. It is all-embracing. It is the source of our ever-growing Bengali sentiment; a spontaneous outburst of joy and happiness. It is organized on the first day of the Bengali new year across Bangladesh both on a small or large scale. However, the Bashakhi fair of Kandirpar in Comilla is the most noteworthy. Local agricultural products, handicrafts, folk items, cottage items, and clay items are the main attractions of this fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FOLK ART AND HANDICRAFT FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"village fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-deepak-maurya-6808935.jpg\" style=\"height:1440px; width:1980px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fair features all sorts of folk and cottage items from across the country</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also amongst the most celebrated fairs in Bangladesh. The Folk Art and Handicraft fair is arranged every year during the middle of January in Narayanganj. Held on the courtyard of Bangladesh Folk Art &amp; Crafts Foundation in Sonargaon, this month-long fair is one of the biggest fairs in Bangladesh. In this folk fair, artists from across the country present themselves with different types of folk arts, handicrafts, and other traditional items. Besides, many people come here specifically to purchase different types of<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/motifs-dhakai-jamdani/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Dhakai Jamdani</a>&nbsp;and<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/nakshi-kantha-history/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;various types of Nakshi Kantha</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BOU-MELA UNDER THE BANYAN TREE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This Bou-Mela has been organized for decades centering on the 400 years old banyan tree in Narayanganj. On the 2nd day of Baishakh, the women devotees of the Hindu religion worship the banyan tree in hopes of good health, happiness, and peace. It is amongst the oldest fairs in Bangladesh that has still been arranged successfully to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FAIR OF LANGALBAND</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"folk fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-yogendra-singh-3452844.jpg\" style=\"height:1440px; width:1980px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Followers of Hindu devotees congregate for the holy bath in this fair</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2nd or 8th phase of the moon in every Bengali month of Chaitra, the devotees of the Hindu religion gather around in Brahmaputra River in the Bandar area of Langalband in Narayanganj for a holy bath. Centering on this occasion, a three-day fair is held on both banks of the Brahmaputra.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LALAN FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lalon fair is organized twice a year centering on the tomb of the mystic artist Lalon Sai in the Cheuriya village of Kumarkhali sub-division of Kushtia. One of them is organized on the occasion of the death anniversary of Lalon Sanji. And the other one is arranged on the occasion of the sainthood introduced by Lalon in Dolpurnima.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RAS FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rasmela (Ras fair) is held every year on the full moon day of Kartik-Agrahayan in Dublar Char of Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world. Many Hindu devotees and tourists flocked from different parts of the country and abroad to participate in the festival. On this occasion, a five-day fair is also held at Dublar Char. The fair has been going on since 1923.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RAS LEELA FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ras Leela, the main religious festival of the Manipuri community, is celebrated on the full moon day of Kartik Agrahayan in Kamalganj and Adampur, two upazilas bordering the Moulvibazar district of Sylhet. This is one of many reasons<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/why-love-sylhet/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;why many people love Sylhet</a>&nbsp;so much. On this occasion, a three-day fair is held in Madhabpur of Kamalganj and the Sanathakur Mandap area of Adampur.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>GURPUKUR FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This traditional fair of the Satkhira region of Bangladesh is more than 300 years old. According to the Bengali calendar, this fair is held at the end of the Bengali month of Bhadra centering on the worship of Manasa. This fair goes on for a month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PORADAHA MELA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This exceptional fair has been held on the banks of Ichhamati River in the Golabari area of the Mahishaban union of Gabtali upazila for 25 years. The two-day fair is held on the last Wednesday of the month of Magh every year. The main attraction of this fair is all sorts of big fish that the merchants bring to sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>MADHU FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A week-long Madhu fair is held every year at Sagardari in Keshabpur upazila of Jessore district. The fair is organized on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the great poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt; the pioneer of Amitrakshara rhyme in Bengali literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RATH FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, the Rath fair is held in the last week of the month of Ashar in the Bengali year. This is one of the significant fairs that the devotees of Hindu religion organize every year. The biggest rath fair is held at Dhamrai in Savar. Besides, Rathkhola fair of Kushtia, Rath fair of Puthia of Rajshahi, Lamapara Rath Yatra Fair of Sylhet are notable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OTHER SPECIAL FAIRS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Chittagong, a week-long fair is held on the banks of Laldighi on the occasion of Jabbar&rsquo;s ball game. Srimangal is home to the ethnic Khasia, Manipuri, Santal, Tipra, and Garo communities. Every year the &lsquo;Fagua Festival&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Baisu Festival&rsquo; of the Tipras, the &lsquo;Ras Festival&rsquo; of the Manipuris and the &lsquo;Wangala Festival&rsquo; of the Garos are celebrated blissfully in the tea gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HOW THE BENGALI FAIRS HAVE SURVIVED</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"folk fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-19-scaled.jpg\" style=\"height:1707px; width:2560px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different types of delicacies are available in the folk fair</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By definition, a fair means a festive arrangement of people buying and selling goods centering on religious or other special occasions at a specific time and a place. However, the arrangement that we call &ldquo;Fair&rdquo; can never be defined as simply in the context of Bangladesh. Because our fairs have also played a role in shaping our society and in many ways helped to develop our rich culture over the years. That is why while some people visit them to purchase things, others visit to embrace the culture and celebrate it. And for<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/high-school-memories/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;kids studying in high school in the 90&rsquo;s</a>, the memories of visiting the fair and having fun might hold a special place in their hearts since these kinds of fairs were more prevalent at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are a variety of modern fairs in Bangladesh, they couldn&rsquo;t diminish the popularity of traditional Bengali fare. And this local tradition which we call &ldquo;Mela&rdquo; is expected to survive for years in<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/folk-urban-culture-bengal/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Bengali folk culture and urban culture</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>', '2021-11-15 05:18:56', '2021-11-15 05:18:56');

So naturally, the way of caring for mental health is also different for everyone. Creating a corner in your home that is custom made according to your needs is the best way to do that. Enjoy playing video games? Set up a corner with your favorite games to disconnect from the world. Is a cup of coffee all you need to de-stress? Then set up a coffee corner for yourself. Do what suits&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>best.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your home is a reflection of your mindset. Unless you can create an environment in your home that positively affects your mindset, it can become difficult to nurture a positive mindset. So just follow these simple tips and you get one step closer to your positive mental health journey.</p>', '2021-11-15 05:20:59', '2021-11-15 05:20:59');
