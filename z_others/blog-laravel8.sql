And that is the story of almost every one of us. &ldquo;Banani 11&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just a road, it has become an unconscious part of our everyday lives. However, contrary to popular belief, Banani Road 11 wasn&rsquo;t always the busy social hub that it is today. The chaotic &ldquo;BFC building&rdquo; was once a home filled with the laughter of kids. The iconic Road 11 was originally intended to serve as a residential area as part of Banani. However, despite being termed as such, the street did not gain the level of popularity for residential purposes as expected. Over time, quite a few significant changes took place and they were the main reasons behind the phenomena that Banani 11 is today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DURING THE 90S</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1.3 km long street, which ended at the lake separating Gulshan and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/advantages-of-living-in-banani/\">Banani</a>, was dotted with a small number of houses.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/banani-next-choice-neighborhood/\">Road 11 was a great place for neighborhood folks</a>&nbsp; to go for a nice afternoon or evening stroll in the 1990s. There was a strong sense of community there, and nearly everyone on the street knew each other. Every now and then, members from each building would gather to either celebrate a special occasion or simply pass the time with some good old-fashioned gossip. It was a pretty close-knit community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the words of Rina Mubin, a long-time resident of the area, Road 11 had gradually lost the charm that it once held as a community. &ldquo;When my kids were growing up in the area, Banani 11 was the place where all their friends would meet up and even go for a walk during the evening. Now the crazy traffic and restaurants at every other corner represent the new Banani 11.I don&rsquo;t think people realize that this place was once built to be a residential area. Oh, how time flies!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BRIDGING THE GAP</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Banani road 11 bridge\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8624.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The famous Banani 11 bridge was built in 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banani road 11 experienced an unexpected change in 2008. A bridge was built over the Gulshan Lake, connecting&nbsp; the two areas. This set in motion a chain of events that transformed Banani Road 11 from a seemingly quiet residential street to a highly sought-after commercial location. Some people began to leave, relocating to a less crowded area suitable for a home. Others began to rent out their residential building spaces to accommodate small businesses. Whatever the exchange was, it was quite evident that a revolutionary change was taking place in the area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growth of different businesses was also a significant change that everyone witnessed in Banani 11. Larger corporations gradually moved in with their offices. Banani Road 11 had completely transformed into a commercial hub within a decade. Restaurants, pharmacies, hotels, businesses, fashion stores, you name it, Banani road 11 has it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/5-most-popular-restaurants-in-banani/\">Banani is known for being the hotspot for restaurants</a>. Many restaurant businesses have started their journey from this road and went on to become successful franchises.&nbsp;<em>Yum Cha District</em>&nbsp;is an ideal example of that. Keeping the business aspect in mind, the popular pan-asian restaurant&nbsp;<em>Yum Cha District&nbsp;</em>started its journey from this iconic road. Explaining their logic behind choosing the road for their business venture, one of the partners of the restaurant Adnan Khan said, &ldquo;With full confidence in what we were offering, we believed Banani 11 would be the perfect place to start our business. The reason being, people from every area of the city visits Banani 11 almost on a regular basis. As we have now been in business for over 6 years now and have expanded the business all over the city, you can say it was a pretty good decision from our end.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Restaurants in Banani road 11\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_9327-1.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many businesses now prefer Banani road 11</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just the locals or the businesses in the area, Banani 11 holds a special place in everyone&rsquo;s hearts. Even people who don&rsquo;t fall into these two categories but are regular visitors of the area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Fardin Fahad, a young professional is the perfect representative of this group. According to Fardin, who frequently visits Banani road 11, Banani&rsquo;s most iconic street has evolved into a more diverse location. With a diverse range of lifestyle stores catering to people from all walks of life, rather than just Banani locals. He says, &ldquo;When I was a student of BRAC University, Banani 11 used to be our regular hangout spot. Now I am working professionally and my office is in Gulshan. However, I still couldn&rsquo;t detach myself from Banani 11. You would find me chilling with my friends in the Banani Crimson Cup after 6:30 p.m. almost every other day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Banani&rsquo;s Road 11 in present day doesn&rsquo;t look anything like how the locals remember it to be. A place that has experienced a strong spirit of the local community, is now one of the biggest social hubs of the city. For better or for worse, we wouldn&rsquo;t trade our dear Banani 11 for anything else.&nbsp;</p>', '2021-11-10 06:10:02', '2021-11-10 06:10:02'),

Instead of cutting your wardrobe in half, use these small closet space ideas to create twice as much space as you had before. So if you are also struggling with closet space, in this article we have picked out some of the best small closet tips for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>UTILIZE THE SPACE UNDER HANGING CLOTHS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"small closet tips\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1896175117.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make good use of the space under hanging clothes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Majority of us hang all our fancy clothes so that they don&rsquo;t crease easily and are maintained well. However, because of this, we are left with a lot of extra space under the hanging clothes. Utilizing that extra space can make for some extra storage space. From jewelry boxes to shoes to everyday clothes, there are many ways you can use the space. You will be surprised to see how much extra space you can create only if you make good use of the space under hanging clothes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>GET SHELF DIVIDERS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Divider for more space\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_2039548502-1.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A divider can be easily installed and removed</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shelf dividers are a great invention for people who are looking for some extra storage space in their closet. There are multiple reasons why a shelf divider is an absolute must-have for a small closet. First and foremost, it&rsquo;s way less expensive than a closet renovation or hiring a professional organizer. It also takes up less space than bins or boxes, while still keeping everything visible and within reach. Plus, a divider can be easily installed and removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BASKETS ARE YOUR BEST FRIEND</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Use baskets for extra storage\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_721686499.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baskets can help you store more things</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baskets are a great organizing tool.

Store all unseasonal items either under the bed or in hard-to-reach spots in your closet. Re-arranging your closet seasonally will help you get some space in your closet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>USE THE DOORS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Closet doors are great for using as storage space that most of us don&rsquo;t pay much attention to. Just by adding some hooks and dividers you can hang your scarves, jewelry and even store socks on the doors of your closet. But make sure that you are not hanging too heavy objects on the doors, this might break them. Some even prefer to use a sliding door instead of a regular door for easy access to the closet. Sliding doors are not only functional but also look good as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>DECLUTTER FROM TIME TO TIME</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Declutter when needed\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-design-1.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose the method that works for you the best and get rid of all the unnecessary items</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And lastly, one of the easiest small closet tips is to declutter your closet from time to time.

So in today&rsquo;s article, we have listed down some important real estate tips for young investors to help them start their investment journey.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RESEARCH THE MARKET&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Research the market\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_280262480.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research the market well to know the prospects</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first step towards investing in real estate is getting well educated and getting enough knowledge about the market. How could you possibly know that you even want to be a real estate investor without knowing what&rsquo;s actually involved? Just because real estate is a lucrative market, that shouldn&rsquo;t be your only motivation. Otherwise it can be a major money pit. Research on what kinds of projects will yield the highest ROI for you. Know more about the trends, market ups and downs, future prospects and then decide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PLAN AHEAD</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Plan for the future\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_1431813467.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning will save you from failing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning is key in every business. And real estate investment is not above it as well. Real estate investment can be complicated and demanding, and a solid plan can keep young investors organized and on task. Do you think with your current income you can save enough to submit the down payment of your first house? Are you eligible to apply for a home loan with your current income? Will your partner be able to help you out during a sudden financial crisis? What are your back-up options if there is a sudden inflation in the market? These are some of the important questions to ask yourself before you consider moving ahead with the investment plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>KNOW WHAT YOU WANT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Know what you want \" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_143785585.jpg\" style=\"height:800px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Know what suits best for you</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youngsters get a bad name for not knowing what they want. But if you let your young enthusiasm get in the way then planning to invest in real estate might backfire for you. There are many different streams of real estate. You need to figure out which one is right for you. Do you want to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/benefits-flipper-house/\" target=\"_blank\">flip a property</a>? Or do you want to leave behind assets for your next generation? Are you interested in owning land? Or are you looking for an apartment to rent out and generate a steady income for yourself? Once you put your finger on what it is that you want, your investment prospects will open up tremendously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SAVINGS WILL SAVE YOU</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"tips for young real estate investors\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_520832017.jpg\" style=\"height:960px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Savings can help you start your investment journey</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you who are super serious about starting to invest in real estate, savings will help you. Depending only on external funding will put a break on your investment dreams if you don&rsquo;t have something saved up to kick start your dream. If you are living paycheck to paycheck then picking up a side hustle could be the way to go for you. Online platforms&nbsp;<em>Upwork</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fiber</em>&nbsp;provide great opportunities for you to start earning some extra money. Rent is another way you can save up some extra cash. If possible try moving in with your parents and save that money for later. You can also choose to live in an affordable area to save money on rent. You will be surprised to see how much you can save.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REGULATION CHANGES</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Real estate changes \" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_138129767.jpg\" style=\"height:958px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep an eye on any significant changes in interest rates or current market trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real estate investment is all about keeping yourself updated with the recent market trends. Just a small change in the regulations can make or break your investment prospects. So one of the biggest tips for young real estate investors is to take advantage of regulation changes. Keep an eye on any significant changes in interest rates, tax breaks or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/tips-real-estate-trends-bangladesh/\">current market trends</a>. For instance, in April 2020, Banks in the country started implementing single digit (9 per cent) interest rates for all kinds of loans (apart from credit cards) in compliance with the government which was previously as high as 13 per cent. So those who took advantage of this opportunity, were highly benefited in the long run as the deduction of the rate had a huge impact on their final payable loan amount.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how appealing it may look from the outside, being a successful young real estate investor is challenging to say the least. However, by just keeping in mind these simple tips mentioned in the article, you will definitely be one step closer to becoming a successful real estate investor.</p>', '2021-11-10 06:17:30', '2021-11-10 06:17:30'),

If&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/care-wooden-furniture/\" target=\"_blank\">maintained properly,</a>&nbsp;it will withstand the test of time. However, over time and as a result of daily use, stains appear on wooden furniture. Often it looks older as a result of spots. But it takes time, labor and money to repurchase a single piece of wood furniture and many people do not want to discard it easily. That&rsquo;s when you need to color or stain your wooden furniture. Varnish, oil and wax have been used for finishing wooden furniture for a long time now. So wondering how to stain or color wooden furniture? In today&rsquo;s article we have broken down the steps for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>SOME THINGS TO REMEMBER&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"কাঠের আসবাব স্টেইন বা কালার করার উপায়\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-blue-bird-7217928.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things to remember</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furniture coloring or staining depends entirely on whether you are actually taking the whole preparation properly or not. The wooden furniture has to be cleaned by rubbing it so that the color or stain will sit on it. If there is any previous stain or dent on the furniture, the result will not be as expected. So, the final result depends on how much you are prepping the furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WORD OF CAUTION&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"কাঠের আসবাব স্টেইন বা কালার করার উপায়\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-blue-bird-7217935.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ways to stain or color your furniture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to choose the place to stain or color the furniture with a lot of thought. A ventilated place should be chosen and a mask must be worn while staining. Also, removing stain or color from your skin can be difficult. So to prevent that, you must wear gloves at all times. Also wear protective glasses to protect your eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>THINGS YOU WILL NEED</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>TOOLS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sandpaper</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sand foam</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brush</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microfiber staining pads</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vacuum machine&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Microfiber cloth</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tack cloth&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constructor masking paper</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Empty color can</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stain</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Color coating</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WAYS TO STAIN OR COLOR YOUR FURNITURE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Often people get confused about how to stain or color wooden furniture. However, staining or coloring wooden furniture is quite easy. You can get it done by yourself. Some tools and time are all you would need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CHOOSE THE WORKSPACE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"কাঠের আসবাব স্টেইন বা কালার করার উপায়\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-anete-lusina-4792523.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose an open space</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly choose an open space with a lot of ventilation. It can be a garage, balcony or an open room. But avoid places with heavy air flow. Use a plastic sheet beforehand to avoid damaging the floor with paint.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>REMOVE EXCESS STUFF</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Remove all excess items from the furniture. Remove all the things that don&rsquo;t need to be rubbed by sandpaper such as hinges, knobs and other decorative items.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RUB THE FURNITURE WITH SANDPAPER</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Carefully rub the whole furniture with sandpaper. Use sandfoam to remove any dark stains or varnish. The furniture should be rubbed well with sandpaper. A lot of the time there could be some remaining paint or varnish on the furniture. In that case, when you try to re-paint it, you might find some difficulties. To avoid this, all the paint and varnish should be removed from the wood by rubbing it well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CLEAN THE DUST</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"কাঠের আসবাব স্টেইন বা কালার করার উপায়\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-la-miko-3616760.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clean the extra dust</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clean the entire furniture with a vacuum cleaner. The whole furniture should also be cleaned with a brush. All dust and dirt must be cleaned properly. Wipe with a clean and white microfiber cloth so that not even a drop of dust is on the furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PREPARE THE WORKSPACE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Move the furniture. Remove the plastic sheet and spread the cloth and spread a large paper or newsprint on the cloth. Then place the furniture on it. So that the fabric does not stick directly to the furniture while staining or coloring. Since the paper is spread out, it is easier to remove it even if it is on stain or colored paper. So it is very important to spread the paper well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>MIX THE COLOR OR STAIN</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"কাঠের আসবাব স্টেইন বা কালার করার উপায়\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-anete-lusina-4792490.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mix the colors well</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open the stain or color can after wearing gloves. Use an opening tool or screwdriver to open the can. Then stir the color with a wooden stick and mix the color well. Make sure the can doesn&rsquo;t move at all. Pour the color into another empty color can.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>START STAINING THE WOOD</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start staining the furniture with a microfiber staining pad or brush. Dip the pad into the stainless can and then squeeze the excess. Next, stain the entire furniture with a pad. You can stain the spots that are more visible at first and when that part is dry, paint the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>CLEAN THE EXCCESS STAIN&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"কাঠের আসবাব স্টেইন বা কালার করার উপায়\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-max-vakhtbovych-6265942.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While painting the furniture, it is always important to make sure the extra part of the furniture doesn&rsquo;t get colored. Keep cleaning them as you go. If you don&rsquo;t do that, there is a possibility of ruining the design and beauty of the furniture. So remove the color before it dries, otherwise it may be difficult to remove the excess color.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LET IT DRY</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wood paint or stain does not take long to dry. You can remove the furniture in a couple of hours if you want. Keep furniture away from dusty places. Otherwise it will sit on the furniture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>USE A PROTECTIVE COATING&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"কাঠের আসবাব স্টেইন বা কালার করার উপায়\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-pixabay-221027.jpg\" style=\"height:900px; width:1440px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use a protective coating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use a high quality protective coating when the paint or stain is finished. However, apply the coating only after making sure that the paint or stain has dried properly. This coating is used to protect wooden furniture. These coatings are used to make the furniture transparent as well. The original color or texture of the furniture remains unchanged and enhances the beauty of the furniture too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WHEN TO CONSULT WITH AN EXPERT</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The design or shape of some wooden furniture is very complex. Shaping such complex designs with sandpaper can also be very critical at times. In cases like this, it would be wise to seek the help of an expert otherwise the color or stain will not sit well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning of time people have been using<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/various-types-furniture/\">&nbsp;different types of wooden furniture.</a>&nbsp;With time many different materials have be introduced but nothing could replace the appeal of wood furniture.&nbsp; The demand for wood as furniture seems to be increasing day by day. However, there are several things to keep in mind before buying furniture. Otherwise it will defuse the entire purpose of it.&nbsp;</p>', '2021-11-10 06:18:12', '2021-11-10 06:18:12'),

And there is no sign of slowing the market down. According to the latest population census, the total housing demand was 8 lakh in 2020 and is expected to surpass 11 lakh in 2030. With an upward-growing market like this, it is only normal that more and more real estate companies in Bangladesh will come into the scene to take a bite of the humongous market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And why wouldn&rsquo;t that be? As far as Bangladesh is concerned, real estate developer companies are the one-stop destination for people who don&rsquo;t have any clear idea as to how they can build a home for themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fact reflects on the real world too. Almost 42% of all the homes in Dhaka are constructed by real estate developer companies. Because in the long run, it&rsquo;s a matter of reliability, overall hassle, and profit.

To me, the arrangement of people having all sorts of fun in flocks, in a setting that could only be compared to a dream full of happiness was like magic. In the little brain of mine, the yet unfathomable positive energy and spirit of people living, breathing, and enjoying was hypnotizing. As far as I can remember, me watching everything unfold before my eyes and having cotton candy while standing in between the ferry&rsquo;s wheel and puppet show stall is what I can clearly recall being awestruck for the very first time in my life. To me, fair sparked joy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-18-scaled.jpg\" style=\"height:1920px; width:2560px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are thousands of fairs in Bangladesh that&rsquo;s been held throughout the year</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as I grew older, I realized a fair is not just a festival and arrangement that makes people happy. It is much more than that. It is a reflection of our culture and tradition. From the Bengali month of Hemanta to Chaitra, you will always find a fair almost every month in some part of our country. It&rsquo;s rooted in our tradition; weaved as though it is an active part of our culture itself. And you will be fascinated by the arrangement surrounding all these fairs the most. Having that said, here are some of the most popular folk fairs in Bangladesh that are also culturally impactful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BAISHAKHI FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"folk fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-20-scaled.jpg\" style=\"height:1707px; width:2560px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Handicrafts are the main attractions of folk fairs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among all the different fairs in Bangladesh, the Baishakhi fair is the most popular one. It is all-embracing. It is the source of our ever-growing Bengali sentiment; a spontaneous outburst of joy and happiness. It is organized on the first day of the Bengali new year across Bangladesh both on a small or large scale. However, the Bashakhi fair of Kandirpar in Comilla is the most noteworthy. Local agricultural products, handicrafts, folk items, cottage items, and clay items are the main attractions of this fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FOLK ART AND HANDICRAFT FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"village fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-deepak-maurya-6808935.jpg\" style=\"height:1440px; width:1980px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fair features all sorts of folk and cottage items from across the country</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also amongst the most celebrated fairs in Bangladesh. The Folk Art and Handicraft fair is arranged every year during the middle of January in Narayanganj. Held on the courtyard of Bangladesh Folk Art &amp; Crafts Foundation in Sonargaon, this month-long fair is one of the biggest fairs in Bangladesh. In this folk fair, artists from across the country present themselves with different types of folk arts, handicrafts, and other traditional items. Besides, many people come here specifically to purchase different types of<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/motifs-dhakai-jamdani/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Dhakai Jamdani</a>&nbsp;and<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/nakshi-kantha-history/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;various types of Nakshi Kantha</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>BOU-MELA UNDER THE BANYAN TREE</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This Bou-Mela has been organized for decades centering on the 400 years old banyan tree in Narayanganj. On the 2nd day of Baishakh, the women devotees of the Hindu religion worship the banyan tree in hopes of good health, happiness, and peace. It is amongst the oldest fairs in Bangladesh that has still been arranged successfully to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FAIR OF LANGALBAND</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"folk fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pexels-yogendra-singh-3452844.jpg\" style=\"height:1440px; width:1980px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Followers of Hindu devotees congregate for the holy bath in this fair</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 2nd or 8th phase of the moon in every Bengali month of Chaitra, the devotees of the Hindu religion gather around in Brahmaputra River in the Bandar area of Langalband in Narayanganj for a holy bath. Centering on this occasion, a three-day fair is held on both banks of the Brahmaputra.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LALAN FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lalon fair is organized twice a year centering on the tomb of the mystic artist Lalon Sai in the Cheuriya village of Kumarkhali sub-division of Kushtia. One of them is organized on the occasion of the death anniversary of Lalon Sanji. And the other one is arranged on the occasion of the sainthood introduced by Lalon in Dolpurnima.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RAS FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Rasmela (Ras fair) is held every year on the full moon day of Kartik-Agrahayan in Dublar Char of Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world. Many Hindu devotees and tourists flocked from different parts of the country and abroad to participate in the festival. On this occasion, a five-day fair is also held at Dublar Char. The fair has been going on since 1923.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RAS LEELA FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ras Leela, the main religious festival of the Manipuri community, is celebrated on the full moon day of Kartik Agrahayan in Kamalganj and Adampur, two upazilas bordering the Moulvibazar district of Sylhet. This is one of many reasons<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/why-love-sylhet/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;why many people love Sylhet</a>&nbsp;so much. On this occasion, a three-day fair is held in Madhabpur of Kamalganj and the Sanathakur Mandap area of Adampur.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>GURPUKUR FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This traditional fair of the Satkhira region of Bangladesh is more than 300 years old. According to the Bengali calendar, this fair is held at the end of the Bengali month of Bhadra centering on the worship of Manasa. This fair goes on for a month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PORADAHA MELA</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This exceptional fair has been held on the banks of Ichhamati River in the Golabari area of the Mahishaban union of Gabtali upazila for 25 years. The two-day fair is held on the last Wednesday of the month of Magh every year. The main attraction of this fair is all sorts of big fish that the merchants bring to sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>MADHU FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A week-long Madhu fair is held every year at Sagardari in Keshabpur upazila of Jessore district. The fair is organized on the occasion of the birth anniversary of the great poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt; the pioneer of Amitrakshara rhyme in Bengali literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>RATH FAIR</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, the Rath fair is held in the last week of the month of Ashar in the Bengali year. This is one of the significant fairs that the devotees of Hindu religion organize every year. The biggest rath fair is held at Dhamrai in Savar. Besides, Rathkhola fair of Kushtia, Rath fair of Puthia of Rajshahi, Lamapara Rath Yatra Fair of Sylhet are notable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>OTHER SPECIAL FAIRS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Chittagong, a week-long fair is held on the banks of Laldighi on the occasion of Jabbar&rsquo;s ball game. Srimangal is home to the ethnic Khasia, Manipuri, Santal, Tipra, and Garo communities. Every year the &lsquo;Fagua Festival&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Baisu Festival&rsquo; of the Tipras, the &lsquo;Ras Festival&rsquo; of the Manipuris and the &lsquo;Wangala Festival&rsquo; of the Garos are celebrated blissfully in the tea gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>HOW THE BENGALI FAIRS HAVE SURVIVED</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"folk fair\" src=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-19-scaled.jpg\" style=\"height:1707px; width:2560px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different types of delicacies are available in the folk fair</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By definition, a fair means a festive arrangement of people buying and selling goods centering on religious or other special occasions at a specific time and a place. However, the arrangement that we call &ldquo;Fair&rdquo; can never be defined as simply in the context of Bangladesh. Because our fairs have also played a role in shaping our society and in many ways helped to develop our rich culture over the years. That is why while some people visit them to purchase things, others visit to embrace the culture and celebrate it. And for<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/high-school-memories/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;kids studying in high school in the 90&rsquo;s</a>, the memories of visiting the fair and having fun might hold a special place in their hearts since these kinds of fairs were more prevalent at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there are a variety of modern fairs in Bangladesh, they couldn&rsquo;t diminish the popularity of traditional Bengali fare. And this local tradition which we call &ldquo;Mela&rdquo; is expected to survive for years in<a href=\"https://www.bproperty.com/blog/folk-urban-culture-bengal/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Bengali folk culture and urban culture</a>.</p>', '2021-11-10 06:20:01', '2021-11-10 06:20:01');
